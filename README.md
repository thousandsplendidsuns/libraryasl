# libraryasl
This particulary repository will be used to house an ongoing project I have, focused on increasing library access to patrons of the Deaf and Hard of Hearing Community. 
I aim to build a site that is sorted into Service Desk Departments, and will have videos of ASL phrases and words commonly used in conversations heard at the 
service desks (Circulation, Youth Services, Information Technology, and Adult Services).
