        <p>16 % of the population have mild to severe hearing loss.
          308,746,000 Americans-12,831 Illinois citizens. 3% have hearing loss in the severe to deaf range
          (2,052,960 Illinois citizens). </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>While access to libraries has always been less clear for patrons with these issues, the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as
          the requirement of masks in most public places, have made such access even harder. While lip-reading is a skill that
          some in the deaf community may have, it has limits-only 30-40% of speech sounds can be lip-read, and that is under
          the best circumstances and contexts-something the pandemic is not.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>As part of my practicum at Dominican University, I am working to create a resource for Indian Trails staff containing
          frequently used words, phrases, and questions in each department. Once completed, the resource will be uploaded to a
           GitHub repository that will be accessible through the staff site.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Special Thanks to the following Indian Trails Staff for their wonderful help in creating this resource!</h2>
